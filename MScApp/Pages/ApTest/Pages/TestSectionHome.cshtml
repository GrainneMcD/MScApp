            <p>
                Verbal reasoning tests assess your ability to understand and comprehend written passages.
                They are designed to measure your verbal comprehension, reasoning and logic, all through your understanding of language.
                Some people when reading a statement jump to conclusions or misinterpret information - this is what the test will be able to find out about you.
